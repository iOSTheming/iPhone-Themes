[![Best iOS Themes for iPhone and iPad](https://github.com/iOSTheming/iPhone-Themes/assets/174579358/bbe95ae9-c175-4f24-87eb-f88bfa06d07e)](https://iospack.com/ithemehub/#ithemehub-themes)

### Development

#### 1. Define the Theme

First, define the theme in a struct. This includes light and dark themes.

```swift
import UIKit

struct Theme {
    static let light = Theme(backgroundColor: .white, textColor: .black)
    static let dark = Theme(backgroundColor: .black, textColor: .white)
    
    let backgroundColor: UIColor
    let textColor: UIColor
}
```

#### 2. Create a Theme Manager

Next, create a theme manager that will handle the current theme.

```swift
class ThemeManager {
    static var currentTheme: Theme = .light
    
    static func applyTheme(theme: Theme) {
        currentTheme = theme
        
        // Apply the theme to the app's appearance
        UIApplication.shared.windows.forEach { window in
            window.backgroundColor = theme.backgroundColor
            window.rootViewController?.view.backgroundColor = theme.backgroundColor
        }
        
        UILabel.appearance().textColor = theme.textColor
        UIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(theme.textColor, for: .normal)
        UITextField.appearance().textColor = theme.textColor
        UITextView.appearance().textColor = theme.textColor
    }
}
```

#### 3. Apply the Theme in the App Delegate

Apply the theme when the app launches. This example uses the light theme by default.

```swift
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        
        // Apply the default theme
        ThemeManager.applyTheme(theme: .light)
        
        return true
    }
}
```

#### 4. Add a Switch to Toggle Themes

Add a switch to the main view controller to toggle between themes.

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    let themeSwitch: UISwitch = {
        let themeSwitch = UISwitch()
        themeSwitch.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        return themeSwitch
    }()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.addSubview(themeSwitch)
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            themeSwitch.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
            themeSwitch.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)
        ])
        
        themeSwitch.addTarget(self, action: #selector(themeSwitchToggled), for: .valueChanged)
    }
    
    @objc func themeSwitchToggled() {
        if themeSwitch.isOn {
            ThemeManager.applyTheme(theme: .dark)
        } else {
            ThemeManager.applyTheme(theme: .light)
        }
        
        updateViewForCurrentTheme()
    }
    
    func updateViewForCurrentTheme() {
        view.backgroundColor = ThemeManager.currentTheme.backgroundColor
    }
}
```

#### 5. Update the View Controller for the Current Theme

Ensure the view controller updates its appearance based on the current theme.

```swift
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)
    updateViewForCurrentTheme()
}
```
